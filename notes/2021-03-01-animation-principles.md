The following principles are valid for all kinds of animations:

- Appearing: ease-out, longer animation
- Disappearing: ease-in, shorter animation
- Moving: ease-in-out
- Long distance / big screen: longer animation
- Short distance / small screen: shorter animation

When fading in list items, that means multiple items:

- overlapping, not one after, not at the same time
- vertical: top to bottom
- grid: top left to bottom right
