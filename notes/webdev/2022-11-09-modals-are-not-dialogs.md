Modals are not another noun for dialogs, but an adjective describing certain types of dialogs:

> Basically, when a modal component is open, it is the only thing that is _not_ inert.
> Only the modal content can be interacted rest with, _the rest of the page_ or application is made inert.
> Inert content is content that users cannot interact with. It is only really there visually,
> but you cannot Tab to it, click it, scroll it or access the content via assistive technologies.
